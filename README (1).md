# 🚀 Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset
This repository contains my internship Task 4 project.In which I built and evaluated a Decision Tree Classifier on the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various personal, social, and economic attributes.

  - graphviz

### ✅ Steps to run
1️⃣ **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/decision-tree-internship.git
or download as a ZIP and extract.

2️⃣ Get the dataset

Download the dataset from UCI Bank Marketing

Place bank-additional-full.csv in the same directory as the notebook (or update the path in the code).

3️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

Target:
y — Has the client subscribed to a term deposit? (yes/no)

📈 Project highlights
✅ One-hot encoding for categorical features
✅ Decision Tree Classifier using entropy criterion
✅ Train-test split (80% train / 20% test, stratified by target)
✅ Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
✅ Visualizations: decision tree plots, top feature importances

💡 Possible future improvements
✨ Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV)
✨ Apply cross-validation for better model reliability
✨ Address class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE, class weights)
✨ Compare performance with other models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
